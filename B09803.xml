            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROPOSALS HUMBLY OFFER'D TO THE HONOURABLE HOUSE of COMMONS.</head>
            <head type="sub">For the taking off the Excise of Beer and Ale, and the settling a better Revenue upon the Crown, in lieu of the Court of Wards and Liveries, by a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then insensible, or inconsiderable; but will very much Enrich the whole Kingdom in General, and at all times will be a good Fond to borrow a Million of Money.</head>
            <p>THE Reasons for the taking off the Excise of Beer and Ale,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Beer and Ale being made out of the Product of Corn, is the principal Cause that all the Arrable Lands in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> fall in Value, and have undone more Farmers since the Year <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. than were undone many Ages before; and it is most certainly true, before that time, never any Act passed to give Money to export Corn out of the Kingdom, but were frequently beholding to Foreign Kingdoms, for the Importation of Corn.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The unreasonableness of the said Acts, that Four or 500000 <hi>l.</hi> yearly should be paid, by less than the fortieth part of the People of the Kingdom; and them, the most are Labourers, Artificers, Handycrafts-men, and poor people, who cannot spend more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney than now they do; and a great number of them cannot live upon their Labours, without paying at least one penny <hi>per</hi> day for Excise, and several a great deal more.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Before the coming up of the Excise, Strong Beer was sold for a penny <hi>per</hi> Quart, according to the Statutes; but upon the
<pb facs="tcp:191969:2"/>coming up of the Excise, the Retailer was allowed to sell it for five Farthings <hi>per</hi> Quart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Before the Year 1662. That the Excise was let to Farm, all Inn-keepers, Victuallers, and most Brewers, Compounded for their Excise, and did not pay the Government one third part of the Duty; and before that time, the Rents of Lands kept up; but the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second Letting the Excise to Farm, the Farmers of the Excise would not Compound with the Brewers, Inn-keepers, or Victuallers, but forced them to pay to the utmost Gallon of Beer, and so it is continued to this day; and if an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count could be taken, what the Excise did produce to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment before the Year 1660. and what it does produce to the Crown at this time, it will appear, it is now treble what it was in those times; and after the Excise was Let to Farmers, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuallers raised their Strong Beer to six Farthings <hi>per</hi> Quart to the poor; so the Brewer and Victualler are no losers by the Excise as they pretend; but it is the Poor that pay it, being forced to drink less, or Smaller Drink, not being able to spend more Money, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which hinders the Consumption of several hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Quarters of Corn, which is the real Cause of undoing the Farmers, and falling the Rents of Land; and if the Excise were taken off, it would certainly advance the Prizes of Lands, to the Rates as formerly; for as there is now Four or 500000 <hi>l.</hi> yearly drained out of the Kingdom into the King's Coffers, if that should cease, there would be the same Mony spent in Beer and Ale as formerly, which would always advance the Prizes of Corn, by making the Consumption so much the greater.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That all the Barly-Lands in <hi>England,</hi> that is sown with Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Malted, and Sold to the Common Brewer, Inn-keeper, or Victualler, pay the King above three times as much as the Farmer pays his Landlord: For Lands that the Tenant pay 12 <hi>s.</hi> or 14 <hi>s.</hi> an Acre, will produce one year with another Five Quarters, which will make Fifteen Barrels, which at 3 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d. per</hi> Barrel amounts to 48 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d.</hi> Lands of 6 <hi>s.</hi> the Acre will produce three Quarters, which make Nine Barrels at 3 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> amounts to 29 <hi>s.</hi> and 3 <hi>d.</hi> and the Coursest Land, not worth 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Acre, will produce above one Quarter, which amounts to 9 <hi>s.</hi> and 9 <hi>d.</hi> And this Burthen lying so heavy upon the Barly, keeps down the Prizes of all other Grain; and the Plow being so heavily oppressed, puts Farmers where their Lands are Inclosed, to lay up their Lands to Feeding and Grasing, by sowing Sinkfoyl, Clover, and several other Seeds, which brings down all other Grasing Lands, so in truth it does effect all the Lands in <hi>England.</hi>

            <list>
               <head>The Particulars in Lieu of the Excise, are,</head>
               <item>I. That the Additional Duties upon Wines by Act of the first of King <hi>James,</hi> be made perpetual; it being certainly true it prevents the exportation of Money, above 100000 <hi>l.</hi> yearly, for Wines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the product of Foreign Countries, the Foreigners are forced to sell their Wines so much the cheaper, as the Duty amounts to; so the Merchant is no loser, nor do Gentlemen pay any dearer than if that Act had never been made.</item>
               <item>II. That the Additional Act that passed the first year of King <hi>James</hi> upon Brandy, <hi>French</hi> wrought Silks, Stuffs, and Linnen, and all other wrought Silks, and all <hi>East-India</hi> Silks and Stuffs, be made perpetual, the effects of which already appears by the making of wrought Silks and Linnen: And if ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> were laid on all Linnen Cloth, Thread, and Haberdashery Ware imported, it would give so great Incouragement to Trade, as in few years all the poor Children in <hi>England</hi> would be taken off, and ease all the Parishes in <hi>England</hi> of the greatest part of their Poor, which now is so heavy a Burden upon them; and would mightily encourage the sowing of Hemp and Flax.</item>
               <item>III. That an Additional Duty of ten pounds <hi>per Cent.</hi> be laid upon all <hi>East-India</hi> Goods, excepting raw Silk and Wool that shall be consumed in <hi>England,</hi> it being no damage to the Company, and insensible to the Consumer.</item>
               <item>IV. That all Pepper consumed in <hi>England</hi> pay eight pence <hi>per</hi> pound weight, and Ginger eight pence <hi>per</hi> pound, and Nutmegs, Cloves, Cinnamon, and Mace pay sixteen pence <hi>per</hi> pound, and all other Grocery-Ware, except Sugar, pay ten pounds <hi>per Cent.</hi> it would be no damage to Trade, and the Burden insensible.</item>
               <item>V. Upon all Salt made in <hi>England</hi> a penny <hi>per</hi> Gallon, it being no more than is paid for every Gallon of Strong Beer and Ale, and a penny <hi>per</hi> Gallon for all Salt imported for one or two years, and after that time two pence <hi>per</hi> Gallon, it being found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that at this time there is as good, if not better Salt made in <hi>England</hi> than is exported out of <hi>France,</hi> or any other parts of the World both for curing of Fish and Flesh; and if this encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were given, in two years time there would be made in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> more Salt than the Kingdom can consume, and at all times, as well in War as in Peace, the Kingdom will be supplied at rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable rates.
<list>
                     <pb facs="tcp:191969:3"/>
                     <item>2. It will be of very great advantage to all Gentlemen that have any Salt Works, or shall erect any new Works for Salt; for at all times they will be good Gainers.</item>
                     <item>3. It will be of great Advantage for all Gentlemen that have any Coal Mines lying near the Sea, by consuming of many thousand Chaldrons of Coals.</item>
                     <item>4. It will increase Navigation, and set many thousands of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to work.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>VI. As Paper is imported by Money exported, if one penny <hi>per</hi> Quire, containing twenty four sheets upon all white Paper, and proportionable upon all other Paper made in <hi>England;</hi> and double the value upon Paper imported, it will be of very great advantage.</item>
               <item>VII. Upon Glass made in <hi>England</hi> ten pounds <hi>per Cent.</hi> and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the value upon all Glass imported.</item>
               <item>VIII. Upon all Deal, Timber, Boards, and Wood imported, it being produced by Money exported, ten or twenty pounds <hi>per Cent.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>IX. Upon Oyl ten pounds <hi>per Cent.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>All these Particulars will amount to the full value of the Excise, and will be a sufficient Fond for His Majesty at all times, during the Wars, to borrow a Million of Money from time to time, and if His Majesties extraordinary Occasions require it, that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise should be continued for one year or a longer time, yet it would put life to the Farmers, and they would use all means possible to go on with their Labours, in hopes and expectation, that they at last may reap the fruits of their Labour.</p>
